# PCA-GPU-based-vector-summation.-Explore-the-differences.
i) Using the program sumArraysOnGPU-timer.cu, set the block.x = 1023. Recompile and run it. Compare the result with the execution confi guration of block.x = 1024. Try to explain the difference and the reason.

ii) Refer to sumArraysOnGPU-timer.cu, and let block.x = 256. Make a new kernel to let each thread handle two elements. Compare the results with other execution confi gurations.
## Aim:
(i) To modify or set the execution configuration of block.x as 1023 & 1024 and compare the elapsed time obtained on Host and GPU.
(ii) To set the number of threads as 256 and obtain the elapsed time on Host and GPU.
